<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The main objectives of this project are to:</p>

<p>1. Analyze the trends and patterns of traveler trips.</p>
<p>2. Determine the most popular destinations among travelers.</p>
<p>3. Identify the typical trip duration and cost.</p>
<p>4. Provide insights and recommendations for travel agencies and businesses.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>1. Python 3.8</p>
<p>2. Google Colab</p>
<p>3. Pandas</p>
<p>4. Matplotlib</p>
<p>5. Seaborn</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
<p>The following data cleaning and preparation steps were performed:</p>

<p>1. Checked for missing data and removed any incomplete rows.</p>
<p>2. Checked for duplicate data and removed any duplicated rows.</p>
<p>3. Converted date columns to datetime format.</p>
<p>4. Identify outliers from the accommodation and transportation cost columns.</p>
<p>5. Calculated the median instead of mean for accommodation and transportation cost columns due to the presence of outliers.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The following exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps were performed:</p>

<p>1. Analyzed the distribution of traveler profiles.</p>
<p>2. Analyzed the distribution of trip durations.</p>
<p>3. Analyzed the distribution of accommodation and transportation costs.</p>
<p>4. Analyzed the distribution of trip destinations and identified the most popular destinations.</p>

<h2>Insights and Recommendations</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following conclusions and recommendations are made:</p>

<p>1. The most popular destinations among travelers are New York, Paris, and Tokyo.</p>
<p>2. The highest year of trips is 2023, and then the number of trips decreases gradually until 2025. This could be due to several factors such as economic downturns, changes in travel trends, or other global events that affect the tourism industry.</p>
<p>3. Traveler demographics such as age and gender have minimal impact on trip preferences. However, traveler nationality could play a significant role in destination choices.</p>
<p>4. Travel agencies and businesses should monitor the trends and adjust their strategies accordingly to stay competitive in the market. They can also consider offering incentives or discounts during off-peak seasons to attract more customers.</p>
